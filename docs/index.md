## Current state

To this date, IST owns the following sport facilities: a indoor gym, two tennis courts, a football field, an outdoor gym and a beach volleyball court. 

The two newest buildings (including sunstone) has no sport or cultural facilities.

The current expansion plan until 2030 does not include any change to the current outdoor sport facilities. About existing indoor facilities, the expansion of the indoor gym has been discussed and postponed every year, for the last three years. About new facilities, it has been considered that some building, finished by 2030, should have some sport or cultural facility. No decisions about their purpose or dimensions have been made yet.

Also, currently, there is no formal connection with any sport club in Klosterneuburg, although there is confirmed interest to have better communication with IST.

In this context, if a formal plan backed by interest of the current people at IST is presented to Construction and Maintenance, it will be seriously considered.
