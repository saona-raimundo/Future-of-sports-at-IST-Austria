Meeting with C&M and Communications team at ISTA.
Very good reception of survey and simple next actions to take.

## From C&M

- Gym has been a proposal for the last 3 years
	- It has not been approved by the management. 
	- The recommendation survey is a valuable resource to make a more convincing request this year, 2022. 
- Budget requests and action plans are sent to the management at the end of summer.

## From Communications

- Campus services is the contact point for many of our issues.
- We should have a more pro-active approach contacting campus services.
	- For example, if a poster with contact information is needed in the gym, then let's propose it to campus services.

## Practical solutions

There were some suggestions that should be canalized as follows.

### Maintenance of gym equipment

- Campus Services is also in charge of the maintenance of our gym. 
- The gym is serviced once a year, if there are additional problems we will have them fixed by our external company “Techno Gym”. 
- If you notice problems/defects please inform us either by sending an email to campus.services@ist.ac.at or to lydia.dussmann@ist.ac.at.

### Requesting new equipment

- Forward requests to some association
	- Students, postdocs or work council

### Making sport-related announcements

- Writing an email to include information in the campus update

### Tennis on campus

- Campus Services is in charge of tennis. 
- If you need further information you can find it here:  https://wiki.ist.ac.at/index.php/Tennis_on_campus 
- The tennis Club OBSV plans to open the tennis courts on May 7, 2022. 
- This will be announced  in the campus update. 
- If you would like to get regular information about the Tennis on campus, please sign up for the mailing list tennis-join@lists.ist.ac.at. 
- CS also sends a list of the current tennis players to the tennis club every year, so please send also an email to lydia.dussmann@ist.ac.at, she will add you to this list.

We have a preliminary analysis of the questionnaire survey and started thinking about the rating survey.

## Answers analysis

There were a total of 152 answers.

### General impressions

- Requests can be clearly classified in short-term and long-term.
	- This is independent of requests for new things or maintenance of equipment.
- People have very concrete ideas of what they want, as opposed of just wanting a "sport facility".
- It is easy to identify popular requests.
- Some requests are already solved by existing facilities.
	- There is a clear need of better internal communication.

### Loose statistics

The following are not exact numbers, but may give an idea of the general direction of requests.

25~35% of people recommended asking for:
- Larger gym
- Multi-purpose indoor court
- Swimming pool

15~25% of people recommended asking for:
- Bouldering
- Lights and toilet for the field
- Maintenance and acquisition of gym equipment 

5~15% of people recommended asking for:
- More (and better) showers on campus
- Accessibility for non-ISTA employee to sports facilities
- Basketball
- Yoga and Pilates space
- Tennis! (internal communications should be strengthen)
- More professional table tennis
- Buy new pool sticks
- Martial arts space
- Running tracks through campus
- Exercise suggestions in the outdoor gym
- Ice-skating

1~5% of people recommended asking for:
- Darts
- Sauna
- Dancing place
- Better maintenance of the field 
- Marking a frisbee field
- Archery
- Parkour park
- Reimbursement of sport expenses in some place in Vienna  

## Ranking survey

- Short vs long term solutions should be separated.
- There should be a way to convey 
	- "minimum requirements"
		- Pool
			- An olympic pool or just for children?
		- Lights for the field
			- Only one lamp or at least three?
	- (Personal) Importance or priority

## Tasks

- Raimundo
	- Ask for space in the Spring festival for promoting sports at ISTA.
- Raimundo and Maayan
	- Contact administration and ask 
		- what information out of the surveys is most useful for them?
		- Are there constrains so we do not ask for impossible things in the questionnaire?

![Poster physical](/images/2021-11-26-poster_physical.png)

![Poster online](/images/2021-11-26-poster_online.png)

## Conclusions

### Suggestions survey

#### Structure

- One opening question about what does the person want to help with
  - Options:
    - New facilities
    - Improvement to current facillities
- One, or two surveys follow.
  - On each survey there are two questions: Indoors and Outdoors
  - Each question shall have an option to see inspirational images
- Finish with some feedback

#### Design

- More pictures
  - All images should be with creative permission
  - Use collage, instead of a carrousel 

#### Observations

- Do not focus too much on sports we can already play (for the example images)

- Lights and water for the field are examples for improvement of existing facilities

- Social or cultural activities are deliberately left out
  
  - There shall be a remark at the beginning and/or end

- Let's make it so that people read the least possible
  
  - Questions should ideally not need any description 

- Introduction videos are allowed only if it helps clarity and simpleness

#### Technicalities

- Limit the input size in free text fields
- Can we have immediate feedback? (number of answers already, answers missing)
  - Nikola says yes
- Images have to be optional
- Grey text on unanswered question shall be useful

### Posters: dissemination of survey

#### Physical version

- Add simple illustration of people at sports
- QR is great
- We will have it only for the second survey (ranking)

#### Online version

- Allows a bit more of text
- We can look into it later

### Campus update: A formal note

- More pressure on management ;)
- Objective: Make a formal statement (as opposed to leading people to the survey)

## Tasks

- Nikola & Vicente
  - Continue designing the survey
  - Ask for feedback whenever there are new drafts (via email) 
- Nick, Rai, Josip
  - Send images for the surveys
  - Remember about Creative common license (easy to do in Google)
- Josip
  - Ask campus update about adding a note
