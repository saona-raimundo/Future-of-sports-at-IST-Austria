# 2023-07-27

We got an official campus-wide annoucement! It appears in the [July 2023 campus update](https://wiki.ist.ac.at/images/e/e8/CampusUpdate_20230727.pdf).

![Campus update notice of gym expansion](/images/2023-07-27-campus_update_notice.png)

It says the following.

	The Future of Leisure & Sports Facilities at ISTA
	
	A survey a few months ago indicated that an improvement to the gym on campus was desired by many members of the ISTA community. The planning for a better gym has begun and aims to result in a significant improvement in training facilities on campus.
	
	The process of drafting a comprehensive campus development concept to address these needs has been initiated. Regarding the gym upgrade, the budget has already been approved for 2023, and the specific schedule for implementation will be finalized once the contractors have submitted their bids, which is expected by the end of August.

After no answer, a second reminder is sent to the dean because no communication has been sent from the management or the dean office about the future expansion of the gym.

A reminder is sent to the dean because no communication has been sent from the management or the dean office about the future expansion of the gym.

---

# 2023-05-17

After conversations with the dean (Eva Benkova), she mentioned that:
1. Management would like to create new communication channels.
   - For our case, going to Construction & Maintenance should not be the way
   - The dean indicated that the creation of this new communication scheme should involve students and postdocs: the people for which the channel is meant for.

2. The gym will be enlarged, only small details remain.
   - The management is supposed to inform about this.
   - The dean wants to send an email promptly to the people interested in sports. For this, we provided the relevant mailing lists.

3. All other proposals are postponed for later work.

# 2023-04-03

After conversations with the dean (Eva), and her conversations with Management about improving communication at ISTA, she requested a summary of what we did.

## Summary

We summarized our progress to the dean (Eva).

	# 2023-03-23

	A summary of the answers of the survey were published in the campus update.
	1. Better gym (44%)
	2. New multi-sport court (24%)
	3. New swimming pool (19%)

	# 2022-04-11

	We analyzed the answers of the survey.

	## Answers analysis

	There were a total of 152 answers.

	### General impressions

	- Requests can be clearly classified in short-term and long-term.
		- This is independent of requests for new things or maintenance of equipment.
	- People have very concrete ideas of what they want, as opposed of just wanting a "sport facility".
	- It is easy to identify popular requests.
	- Some requests are already solved by existing facilities.
		- There is a clear need of better internal communication.

	### Loose statistics

	The following are not exact numbers, but may give an idea of the general direction of requests.

	25~35% of people recommended asking for:
	- Larger gym
	- Multi-purpose indoor court
	- Swimming pool

	15~25% of people recommended asking for:
	- Bouldering
	- Lights and toilet for the field
	- Maintenance and acquisition of gym equipment 

	5~15% of people recommended asking for:
	- More (and better) showers on campus
	- Accessibility for non-ISTA employee to sports facilities
	- Basketball
	- Yoga and Pilates space
	- Tennis! (internal communications should be strengthen)
	- More professional table tennis
	- Buy new pool sticks
	- Martial arts space
	- Running tracks through campus
	- Exercise suggestions in the outdoor gym
	- Ice-skating

	1~5% of people recommended asking for:
	- Darts
	- Sauna
	- Dancing place
	- Better maintenance of the field 
	- Marking a frisbee field
	- Archery
	- Parkour park
	- Reimbursement of sport expenses in some place in Vienna

	This survey was designed during the previous two months, with close contact to C&M, GSA and Communications at ISTA.

# 2023-03-23

A summary of the answers of the survey were published in the campus update.

![Campus update summary of answers](/images/2023-03-23-campus_update.png)

Since 2021, the "Future of Sports" working
group aims to improve sports at ISTA. At the
end of 2021, an institute-wide survey with 151
participants lead to 302 suggestions for the
improvement of ISTA’s sports facilities. We
heard you loud and clear. The top three
suggestions are:
1. Better gym (44%)
2. New multi-sport court (24%)
3. New swimming pool (19%)
It is time to act! For the fifth year in a row,
C&M will give a detailed plan for expanding the
gym to Management.

# 2023-03-21

We wrote to Campus Update to include the following note.

	- Future of Sports at ISTA - news
	In the institute-wide survey at the end of 2021
	we had 151 participants giving 302 suggestions 
	on sports development at ISTA. We heard you loud and clear. 
	The top three suggestions are:
	1. Better gym (44%)
	2. New multi-sport court (24%)
	3. New swimming pool (19%)
	It is time to act! For the fifth year in a row, 
	C&M will give a detailed plan for expanding the gym to Management.

Let's see what they include!


# 2023-03-14

After many emal exchanges, we finally got the new that ISTA employees were asked by the Management to present a plan on how to expand the gym and the associated costs of doing so. In the near future, a plan will be presented to the president. For now, the plan includes more devices and renovation of washrooms.

No other information has been recovered from our contact with ISTA.

# 2022-06-09

Construction & Maintenance talked with Management about the results of the survey and the first idea of expanding the gym. 

Before a concrete answer to the petitions, they received the order to make a comparison with other institutes about:
- size,
- service,
- costs, and 
- access to gym. 
Elke (Head of Campus Service) is now in charge of contacting several other institutions about their offers.



# 2022-04-15

Meeting with C&M and Communications team at ISTA.
Very good reception of survey and simple next actions to take.

## From C&M

- Gym has been a proposal for the last 3 years
	- It has not been approved by the management. 
	- The recommendation survey is a valuable resource to make a more convincing request this year, 2022. 
- Budget requests and action plans are sent to the management at the end of summer.

## From Communications

- Campus services is the contact point for many of our issues.
- We should have a more pro-active approach contacting campus services.
	- For example, if a poster with contact information is needed in the gym, then let's propose it to campus services.

## Practical solutions

There were some suggestions that should be canalized as follows.

### Maintenance of gym equipment

- Campus Services is also in charge of the maintenance of our gym. 
- The gym is serviced once a year, if there are additional problems we will have them fixed by our external company “Techno Gym”. 
- If you notice problems/defects please inform us either by sending an email to campus.services@ist.ac.at or to lydia.dussmann@ist.ac.at.

### Requesting new equipment

- Forward requests to some association
	- Students, postdocs or work council

### Making sport-related announcements

- Writing an email to include information in the campus update

### Tennis on campus

- Campus Services is in charge of tennis. 
- If you need further information you can find it here:  https://wiki.ist.ac.at/index.php/Tennis_on_campus 
- The tennis Club OBSV plans to open the tennis courts on May 7, 2022. 
- This will be announced  in the campus update. 
- If you would like to get regular information about the Tennis on campus, please sign up for the mailing list tennis-join@lists.ist.ac.at. 
- CS also sends a list of the current tennis players to the tennis club every year, so please send also an email to lydia.dussmann@ist.ac.at, she will add you to this list.

- Poster prototype

![Poster physical](/images/2021-11-26-poster_physical.png)

![Poster online](/images/2021-11-26-poster_online.png)

## Conclusions

### Suggestions survey

#### Structure

- One opening question about what does the person want to help with
  - Options:
    - New facilities
    - Improvement to current facillities
- One, or two surveys follow.
  - On each survey there are two questions: Indoors and Outdoors
  - Each question shall have an option to see inspirational images
- Finish with some feedback

#### Design

- More pictures
  - All images should be with creative permission
  - Use collage, instead of a carrousel 

#### Observations

- Do not focus too much on sports we can already play (for the example images)

- Lights and water for the field are examples for improvement of existing facilities

- Social or cultural activities are deliberately left out
  
  - There shall be a remark at the beginning and/or end

- Let's make it so that people read the least possible
  
  - Questions should ideally not need any description 

- Introduction videos are allowed only if it helps clarity and simpleness

#### Technicalities

- Limit the input size in free text fields
- Can we have immediate feedback? (number of answers already, answers missing)
  - Nikola says yes
- Images have to be optional
- Grey text on unanswered question shall be useful

### Posters: dissemination of survey

#### Physical version

- Add simple illustration of people at sports
- QR is great
- We will have it only for the second survey (ranking)

#### Online version

- Allows a bit more of text
- We can look into it later

### Campus update: A formal note

- More pressure on management ;)
- Objective: Make a formal statement (as opposed to leading people to the survey)

## Tasks

- Nikola & Vicente
  - Continue designing the survey
  - Ask for feedback whenever there are new drafts (via email) 
- Nick, Rai, Josip
  - Send images for the surveys
  - Remember about Creative common license (easy to do in Google)

### Message

Dear athletes of IST,

we (Raimundo Julian Saona Urmeneta, Nikola Zarevski and myself) have set
up a working group in which we want to "plan the future of sports at
IST". In particular, we want to collect, discuss, summarize and most
importantly vocalize the opinions of IST employees regarding the
improvement of the sports facilities on campus. We are interested in
suggestions either regarding our current facilities or the planning of
new ones that could be installed in the course of further development of
the campus.

Our current plan of action is to

1. collect improvement and planning suggestions from all interested
employees in an online survey,

2. evaluate the wider support for and perceived importance of each
suggestion in a follow up online poll,

3. compile the poll results into a formal proposal that we will present
to the Construction & Maintenance division.

If you are interested in orchestrating this process together with us,
write me a mail and/or come to our next meeting on Thursday, 18th of
November at 1700 in the Error Bar.

If you would just like to suggest an improvement, please wait until we
have set up the first online survey. We will send a mail to all
employees once this is in place.

Best,

Nick
