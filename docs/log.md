## Conclusions

### Suggestions survey

#### Structure

- One opening question about what does the person want to help with
  - Options:
    - New facilities
    - Improvement to current facillities
- One, or two surveys follow.
  - On each survey there are two questions: Indoors and Outdoors
  - Each question shall have an option to see inspirational images
- Finish with some feedback

#### Design

- More pictures
  - All images should be with creative permission
  - Use collage, instead of a carrousel 

#### Observations

- Do not focus too much on sports we can already play (for the example images)

- Lights and water for the field are examples for improvement of existing facilities

- Social or cultural activities are deliberately left out
  
  - There shall be a remark at the beginning and/or end

- Let's make it so that people read the least possible
  
  - Questions should ideally not need any description 

- Introduction videos are allowed only if it helps clarity and simpleness

#### Technicalities

- Limit the input size in free text fields
- Can we have immediate feedback? (number of answers already, answers missing)
  - Nikola says yes
- Images have to be optional
- Grey text on unanswered question shall be useful

### Posters: dissemination of survey

#### Physical version

- Add simple illustration of people at sports
- QR is great
- We will have it only for the second survey (ranking)

#### Online version

- Allows a bit more of text
- We can look into it later

### Campus update: A formal note

- More pressure on management ;)
- Objective: Make a formal statement (as opposed to leading people to the survey)

## Tasks

- Nikola & Vicente
  - Continue designing the survey
  - Ask for feedback whenever there are new drafts (via email) 
- Nick, Rai, Josip
  - Send images for the surveys
  - Remember about Creative common license (easy to do in Google)
- Josip
  - Ask campus update about adding a note
