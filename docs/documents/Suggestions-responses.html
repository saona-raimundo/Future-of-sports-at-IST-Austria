Also, we used to have yoga classes at IST, and they were really really good, but now the instructor has left, so we don't have it anymore.

In particular, the barbell for the bench press is non standard and causes a dangerous situation when the weights on it bump into the holding-hooks of the press- as this disruption can cause a person to drop the heavy weight on their body.   <br />
<br />
My suggestion is to purchase a standard olympic/powerlifting barbell, and a set of plates ranging from 1.25, 2.5,5, and 10 kilos. 20 kilo weights are already abundant and not necessary to purchase. <br />
<br />
Additionally, on a lower priority than the barbell, the gym sound system is outdated and difficult to use.</td>

Additional gym space and renovations would be useful too, as it gets quite crowded and is a popular activity at IST. It would be fantastic to have more treadmills, and a space to do olympic weightlifting. If it were built in the fashion of a CrossFit gym (where all equipment is movable and stored on the sidelines) it would be possible to host other fitness events in that space- for example Yoga classes, martial arts, etc.<br />

One point about it - I think the space could be used much more efficiently by separating the yoga and stretching area into the corridor outside, or another room in the building. I think it makes sense to have the weights and machines all located in the same room, but its both a safety issue and practical use issue to have the Yoga/stretching area in the middle of the gym. </td>

            <td class="column2 style4 s">There are a lot of rock climbers at IST Austria, and I think it would make a ton of sense to have a small bouldering area on campus. <br />
<br />
A Kilterboard would be an extremely efficient use of space and money. A Kilterboard is a 12'x12' board, with a grid of &quot;standardized&quot; climbing holds. The board can change its angle - to create extremely easy or impossibly difficult problems - perfect for a place like IST with a variety of climbing skills. The route-setting (the process of designing new routes to climb, which is the time-consuming and expensive part of owning a climbing gym) is crowdsourced, due to the standardized set of holds - people from all over the world log onto the app and create, rate, and discuss different routes using a specified set of holds. Last I checked there were about 50,000 routes, of all possible difficulties, on the app.<br />
<br />
A kilterboard is relatively cheap (~$10K, I think) and they don't take up much space (the board is 12' x 12', you wouldnt even need to build a new building!), on the scale of building an indoor exercise facility.  Bouldering on a Kilterboard is also one of the safest ways to climb. Because of the ability to change the angle, this is extremely inclusive - anyone, from a beginner to an absolute expert can find an appropriate route to climb. </td>

            <td class="column0 style4 s">On the short term: it would be nice, if the gym gets a little touch-up. Like fixing both showers (for real), deep cleaning of everything, establishing timely supply of shower gel and paper towels (the rolling ones near kitchen). Maybe a couple new mats instead of the old ones. Also, the water from kitchen sink in gym is unsafe to drink. I had horrible stomachaches a couple times after drinking it. This must be fixed!!! At least by putting a warning sign... On the long term: would be perfect to have a second (wider, better) treadmill. Sometimes there is a queue for using the existing one, especially during the busy hours. A more stable pull up stand would also be nice. And obviously extending gym or creating the second one. But that is only in our dreams, I guess. In general, none of those things are of an extreme importance. Just my suggestions.</td>
